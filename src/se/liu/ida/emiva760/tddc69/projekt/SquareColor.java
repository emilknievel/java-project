/**
 * ======================
 * File: SquareColor.java
 * ======================
 *
 * This file contains the different colors that the blocks can have.
 *
 * The gray blocks indicate that they are harder to break (perhaps they
 * require 3 hits instead of one).
 *
 * The player's paddle is white, the exploding blocks are yellow and the rest
 * of the blocks use random colours varying between the ones that are left
 * over.
